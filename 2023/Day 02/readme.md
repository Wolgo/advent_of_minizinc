As this problem is just a pure calculation, there is not much sense in trying to do this in minizinc.
I try to force the problem into MiniZinc, but gathering the data already gave me the answer quite closely.

So for fun I made the following task:

Assuming that the games happened as the elf showed, if you are given an X amount of uncolored dice, what is the maximum amount of games you can make possible by painting each die?

I added another: Assuming all games were possible, but the elf switched the dice in the bag at one point, what is the lowest amount of dice that have to have been in the bag at some point.
Seems like my instance is always resulting in 60 for that though.
