As this problem is just a pure calculation, there is not much sense in trying to do this in minizinc.
I try to force the problem into MiniZinc, but gathering the data already gave me the answer quite closely.

So for fun I made the following task:

Assuming that the games happened as the elf showed, if you are given an X amount of uncolored dice, what is the maximum amount of games you can make possible by painting each die?
